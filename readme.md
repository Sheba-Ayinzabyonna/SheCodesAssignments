Move your CodeSandbox project to VS Code, link it to a GitHub repository and deploy your code to Netlify. CodeSandbox link https://codesandbox.io/s/clever-mccarthy-kotfr0?file=/src/index.js:0-2539 in the browser link https://kotfr0.csb.app/

Submit your Netlify URL linking to your project. Include a link to your GitHub repository at the bottom of your project page. The project doesn't have to be fully functional but it should look exactly the same as when opening it on your local computer.
